Strapi Content Grid with Pagination and Lightbox
This is a simple, client-side web application that demonstrates how to fetch and display content from a Strapi CMS API, complete with pagination for easy navigation and a lightbox modal to view full article details.

‚ú® Features
Content Fetching: Dynamically pulls articles from a Strapi API endpoint.

Pagination: Implements "Previous," "Next," and numbered page buttons to navigate through content.

Responsive Grid Layout: Displays articles in an adaptable grid format suitable for various screen sizes.

Article Lightbox: Clicking "Read More" opens a full article view in a modern, overlaying modal.

Rich Text Rendering: Properly formats and displays rich text content (paragraphs, headings, lists) from Strapi's Lexical editor output.

Loading Indicator: Shows a visual loading spinner while content is being fetched from the API.

Error Handling: Displays user-friendly messages for API errors or unexpected data.

üöÄ Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web page.

CSS3: Styling (custom CSS for animations and core layout, complemented by Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling).

JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic for fetching data, rendering UI, and handling interactions.

Strapi CMS: Used as the headless content management system providing the article data via its API.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and How to Run

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or dragging it into your browser.

The application will automatically fetch content from your configured Strapi API URL and display it.
